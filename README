Instructions to run the project via command line
- Execute 'git clone https://github.com/skalsi316/savechildren' in command line. 
  This will clone the project to the folder you are in. 
- Then go to the savechildren folder stored - 'cd savechildren'
- Run 'mvn clean install'. You should see the junit test run 
- Execute 'java -jar target/rest-api-0.1.0.jar' and you should see the test. 

If i had more time i would have created the db connection file using MySQL with a table so you could see the entries 
being imported to the database.
